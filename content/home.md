Hey there! I'm a software developer: I build websites, desktop apps, Android apps, embedded software for things like the ESP8266 and graphical calculators, and more.

This website is where I list the stuff I work on and that may not be on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/gbl08ma). I also have [a blog](https://gbl08ma.com/) where, once in a blue moon, I uninspiredly write uninspiring posts and rants about either stuff I'm working on, or things that are happening.

If you're still with me, you can move on to the [projects list](/projects), or read more [about me](/about).
