An add-in for the Casio fx-CG 10/20 calculators that provides many tools, including:

- a complete file manager, with file search, clipboard, compression (using the heatshrink lib)...
- text editor
- image viewer (JPEG only, see also [the complete, standalone version](/projects/imageviewer))
- calendar (with events, event search, month, week and day views...)
- chronometer

...and much more. I even glued in a scripting engine (PicoC, not my creation) so that other people could use my own UI toolkit and helper functions, combining all of the code contained in Utilities as they please.

It's possibly the least popular of my calculator programs, but the one that contains the most original code and the one I enjoyed developing the most.
