**[Go to the website](https://tny.im)**

A website that takes URLs, email addresses, lists of links, text snippets, etc. and gives a short URL for them. It's based on YOURLS, but I build a huge shell around it, with everything that makes it more than a URL shortener. No plans to open-source it - it's a giant mess of PHP code which I only touch for security fixes.
