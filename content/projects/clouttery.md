**[Go to the website](https://clouttery.xyz)**

A battery monitoring web service. It lets you see the battery history for all of your devices in one place, and you can get notifications about the batteries. Using Go, C#, Java and Python, I built a custom backend and website, [clients](https://clouttery.xyz/apps) for Windows, Android and Linux, and even a billing system... it's one of those ambitious projects that always feels 10% done. _So many ideas, so little time..._

Because this project actually encompasses multiple ones (clients, server, website, user documentation...), there's always something to do, so even if I get tired of working on one part, I can just move to another one, in a different language, with different tools.

At least certain parts will be open-sourced, eventually. Especially if I decide to give up on this project.
