An image viewer for the fx-CG 10 / 20 calculators.

I took libpng and ChaN's JPEG decoding library, made small tweaks so things were a bit faster on the calculator's limited CPU and memory, and designed an appropriate user interface. I didn't write much code and it's nothing particularly novel, however, of my add-ins, this is probably the most popular one in online calculator communities - sometimes, the simplest things are enough to satisfy the needs of the users.
